ITSM Dataset Prediction
About the Project
This project is all about predicting the priority of IT service tickets based on their Impact and Urgency. The aim is to build a model that can classify tickets into different priority levels such as High, Medium, and Low. By doing this, IT teams can manage their work better by knowing which tickets to prioritize.

Dataset Details
Impact: How serious or disruptive the issue is (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

Urgency: How quickly the issue needs to be fixed (e.g., Immediate, High, Normal, Low).

Priority: The final priority of the ticket (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

Goal of the Project
Goal: Build a machine learning model to predict the Priority of tickets.

How:

We clean and process the data (fixing missing values, converting text into numbers, etc.).

We train different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to see which one works best.

Then, we evaluate how well the model performs using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas: For handling the data

Scikit-learn: For creating machine learning models

XGBoost: For boosting the performance of the models

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Steps Followed
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the data by fixing any missing values.

Converted categorical values (like Impact and Urgency) into numerical form.

Split the data into training and testing parts.

Model Training:

Trained several models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to classify the priority of tickets.

Tried to tune the models to get the best results.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated each model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Used confusion matrix to understand misclassifications.

Future Work
Model Deployment: Integrate the best model into an IT system so that it can predict the priority of new tickets in real-time.

Improve the Dataset: Add more features to the data to make the predictions more accurate (e.g., add department, ticket category, etc.).

Optimize the Models: Try more advanced models and techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
